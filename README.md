# Hello there! #

I am very grateful for your course. It's been very interesting (and difficult sometimes). I hope I will be able to finish it before the deadline. </br>
Here, I will post some information on my progress on each topic.

# General #

## Git Basics ##

I have listened to the first two weeks of the course Introduction to Git and GitHub: [1 week](general/git-basics/week-1.png) and [2 week](general/git-basics/week-2.png) </br>
I've passed some levels on learngitbranching: [Introduction Sequence](general/git-basics/branching-1.jpg) and [Push & Pull](general/git-basics/branching-1.jpg).</br>
I have also managed to create a pull-request.

## Linux CLI and Networking ##

It's been pretty difficult but very interesting. I passed all the quizzes on Linux Survival but I have to admit that I wasn't able to do it at my first try. Here are some screenshots: [quiz 1](general/linux-cli-and-networking/quiz-1.jpg), [quiz 2](general/linux-cli-and-networking/quiz-2.jpg), [quiz 3](general/linux-cli-and-networking/quiz-3.jpg), [quiz 4](general/linux-cli-and-networking/quiz-4.jpg). I hope you all will fogive me for posting these screens in the folder that is not named *task_linux_cli*.</br>
I've also read about HTTP protocol but it was difficult for me. I think I should get back to this topic later and try to understand everything again.

## VCS, GitHub and Collaboration ##

I have listened to the [3rd](general/vcs-github-and-collaboration/week-3.png) and [4th](general/vcs-github-and-collaboration/week-4.png) weeks of the course Introduction to Git and GitHub.</br>
I've passed some more levels on learngitbranching: [Screen 1](general/vcs-github-and-collaboration/branching-3.jpg) and [Screen 2](general/vcs-github-and-collaboration/branching-4.jpg). It's been even more difficult and I hope that more practice will help me to understand everything.

# Front-End Basics #

## Intro to HTML & CSS ##

It took me longer than I expected. But I've made it through [1st](front-end-basics/intro-to-html-and-css/week-1.png) and [2nd](front-end-basics/intro-to-html-and-css/week-2.png) weeks of Introduction to Responsive Design. First lessons in [Learn HTML](front-end-basics/intro-to-html-and-css/learn-html.jpg) and [Learn CSS](front-end-basics/intro-to-html-and-css/learn-css.jpg) are done as well. I will continue doing tasks there but first I will try to continue my way on this course. Also, I watched 3-15 videos from [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG4F9nAIYNS5oAiPotxwLFIr). I tried to do all the tasks from the description of the videos and I can see that browsers can be annoying.

## Responsive Web Design ##

I've known a few things about flexbox so learning about it was not that difficult. [Flexbox Froggy](front-end-basics/responsive-web-design/flex-frogs.jpg) was a really nice game, though I had to think a lot before passing the last level. 
Grid Layout was muuuuuuch more difficult for me. I don't think I've understood enough. [Grid Garden](front-end-basics/responsive-web-design/grid-garden.jpg) helped a lot to understand some basic things. Still,  I will have to get back to this topic.

## HTML & CSS Practice ##
