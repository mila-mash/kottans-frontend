# Hello there! #

I am very grateful for your course. It's been very interesting (and difficult sometimes). I hope I will be able to finish it before the deadline. </br>
Here, I will post some information on my progress on each topic.

# General #

## Git Basics ##

I have listened to the first two weeks of the course Introduction to Git and GitHub: [1 week](general/git-basics/week-1.png) and [2 week](general/git-basics/week-2.png) </br>
I've passed some levels on learngitbranching: [Introduction Sequence](general/git-basics/branching-1.jpg) and [Push & Pull](general/git-basics/branching-1.jpg).</br>
I have also managed to create a pull-request.

## Linux CLI and Networking ##

It's been pretty difficult but very interesting. I passed all the quizzes on Linux Survival but I have to admit that I wasn't able to do it at my first try. Here are some screenshots: [quiz 1](general/linux-cli-and-networking/quiz-1.jpg), [quiz 2](general/linux-cli-and-networking/quiz-2.jpg), [quiz 3](general/linux-cli-and-networking/quiz-3.jpg), [quiz 4](general/linux-cli-and-networking/quiz-4.jpg). I hope you all will fogive me for posting these screens in the folder that is not named *task_linux_cli*.</br>
I've also read about HTTP protocol but it was difficult for me. I think I should get back to this topic later and try to understand everything again.
